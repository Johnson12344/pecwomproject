                Approval:

                instructions if the return is approved.
                Pack and Ship:

                Carefully pack the item(s) in their original packaging and include the RA number in the package.
                Ship the item(s) to the address provided in the return instructions.
                Note: Customers are responsible for return shipping costs unless the return is due to a defective or
                incorrect item.

                c. Non-Refundable Costs:
